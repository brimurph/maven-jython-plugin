Introduction

	The maven-jython-plugin is a plugin for the {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Maven 2}} project management system that allows {{{http://www.jython.org}Jython}} to be integrated into your projects.

Current Status

	The plugin is admittedly in a very nascent state.  It has, however, been used to generate commercial software.  We use it to 
	build our open source WebReboot(R) command-line tool.  The  plugin is available as open source software
	under the {{{http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html}Apache Software License v2}}.
	
	You can check out the code from our public Subversion repository at: {{{http://dev.servprise.com/svn/maven-jython-plugin/trunk/}http://dev.servprise.com/svn/maven-jython-plugin/trunk/}}.

	We will update this page as the plugin matures, but if you'd like to keep in touch with the ongoings, you may want to subscribe to our
	{{{http://dev.servprise.com/weblog/}weblog}}.  In the interest of full disclosure, please note that this weblog also contains
	posts unrelated to this plugin, mostly for Servprise product developments.  We do try to make good use of categories so that you
	can filter out posts as appropriate, however.
